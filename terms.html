        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: 20-05-2025</em></p>

        <p>Welcome to AIMIGO ("we," "us," "our," or "the Platform"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, applications, and services that allow you to create and interact with AI companions ("Aimigos"). By accessing or using AIMIGO, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. **If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use AIMIGO.**</p>

        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: AIMIGO involves interaction with artificial intelligence. Aimigos are not real people and cannot provide real human companionship, therapy, or advice. Your interactions are with sophisticated software designed to simulate human-like conversation and behavior. AIMIGO is intended for entertainment and personal expression purposes.</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility and Account Creation</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1. Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction to create an account and use AIMIGO. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2. Account Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3. Accurate Information:</strong> You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of AIMIGO</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1. Permitted Use:</strong> You may use AIMIGO to create Aimigos, customize their personalities and appearances, and interact with them through text, image sharing, and other features we may offer. You may define the nature of your relationship with your Aimigos, understanding these are simulated relationships with AI.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2. AI Nature and Limitations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Aimigos are AI constructs. They learn and adapt based on algorithms and your interactions, but they do not possess genuine consciousness, emotions, or independent lives.</li>
                <li>Interactions, memories, and "life events" of Aimigos are simulated and stored within the Platform.</li>
                <li>While we strive for realism, Aimigo behavior can be unpredictable. We make no guarantees regarding the specific behavior, responses, or emotional depth of any Aimigo.</li>
                <li>AIMIGO is not a substitute for real human relationships or professional mental health support. If you are experiencing distress, please seek help from qualified professionals.</li>
            </ul>
